# Based Upon...

Uses the MuPDF WASM stuff [from here](https://ghostscript.com/~tor/wasm/readme.html), which probably comes from the [MuPDF project](https://mupdf.com/) (WASM release Aug 2019).  MuPDF source code is [GNU AGPL licensed](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html).

Uses the [WASM ImageMagick compile by KnicKnic](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html), licensed with the Apache 2.0 License.
