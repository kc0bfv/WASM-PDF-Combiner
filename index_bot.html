                <h3>Usage</h3>
                Click "Add File" then use the file browser to select one or more PDF files.  Rearrange them, change the start and end pages, duplicate or remove them in the file list area.  Modify the quality if you wish.  The quality will have a large effect on the output file size and processing time.  I recommend 120 DPI for a good balance.
                Click "Combine" to produce the output PDF - your browser will automatically download the result.

                <p>This tool requires no external resources and makes no external requests.  Therefore, it can make no invasion on your privacy.  You may verify these statements by using your browser's developer utilities to view network traffic - you will see that only the HTML file and "data" URLs are loaded.  Data URLs come from contents within this page, not external sources.  You may also verify these statements by using the tool entirely in offline mode, or disconnected from the Internet.  It will work fully.</p>
